          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">The choices you make should not be made because you do not know any better. They should be made because you have explored all that you wanted to and are thus making the choice that you are making.</p>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-3 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">And creating awareness is the purpose I find myself most drawn towards right now.</p>
          <h1 className="text-3xl py-3 lg:py-0 font-bold text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">Growing up</h1>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-1 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">I was one of those rare kids in school that always knew what I wanted to do in life.
And it was a 3-step plan.</p>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-3 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">Go to the US for my PhD</p>
          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">Join NASA as a space scientist</p>
          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">Become the first man on Mars</p>
          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">I came from extremely humble beginnings. We never had enough. Hand to mouth existence. Always out of money.</p>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-3 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">So to even dream to go to the US was crazy, let alone doing it.</p>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-3 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">My parents, irrespective of our financial situation, always ensured that my sister and I got a good education. Their dreams were pegged on us. We were the ones to change our family’s orbit.</p>
          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">I worked hard towards that and made it to a top US university for a PhD. program in Physics, on a full scholarship (the only way we could have afforded it).</p>
          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">I recall my dad taking a loan of Rs. 55,000 to pay for the one-way ticket to the US.</p>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-3 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">That was 2002.</p>
          <h1 className="text-3xl  py-3 lg:py-0 font-bold text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">My 20s</h1>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-1 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">I landed in the US, was doing extremely well in my class, but something was missing.
Not sure what, I began to have these tough conversations with myself.</p>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-3 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">And that is when I realized – I was good with Physics, but I wasn’t happy doing it.</p>
          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">And I decided to come back to India, dropping out of my PhD program.
I was 24.</p>
          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">No plan of what to do.</p>
          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">No savings.</p>
          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">No financial backing.</p>
          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">And nothing waiting for me back in India.</p>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-3 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">I decided to reset my life at 24 and start all over again.
Someone suggested I go for an MBA.</p>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-3 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">And I came across this rather young school called ISB.
I applied and fortunately got through.
And that 1 year at ISB changed my life forever.</p>
          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">Joined Kearney as a management consultant, post ISB. Worked there for 3 years until 2009.

Alongside Kearney, I started to work with a couple of batch mates from ISB on my first venture – called SecondShaadi.com</p>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-3 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">In 2009, I quit consulting to join the startup full-time and over the next couple of years we built several other websites across automobiles, education, finance. The big one of that became Gaadi.com, which eventually got sold to goibibo.com in 2010.</p>
          <h1 className="text-3xl  py-3 lg:py-0 font-bold text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">My entrepreneurial journey</h1>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-1 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">Post SecondShaadi.com and Gaadi.com, in 2011, I started Groupon’s India business as the founding CEO. And led the business for 4 years until 2015. In 2013, I was also given the additional responsibility of managing Groupon APAC countries of Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines.</p>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-2 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">In 2015, we did something rather audacious.
Along with the core management team of Groupon India we bought the Groupon India business from Groupon and made it into an independent entity. Thus started nearbuy, which was funded by Sequoia. I acted as the CEO of nearbuy until 2019 when I stepped down, with 2 other founders running the company on a day-to-day basis.

These 9 years taught me so much.
About people, about building businesses, about fundraising, about investing.
More than anything else, about my own self. Who am I? What am I good at? What should I do and should not do?

I became a student of consumer behavior. A student of how people think, why they behave the way they do and what drives people to work their best (or not).

In 2016, as a way to create an employer brand and attract the best talent, I started an online video series called “warikoo Wednesdays” on LinkedIn. I spoke about my experiences as a founder, a CEO and a people manager. My learning from that.</p>
          <p className="text-xl lg:py-3 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">And somehow that clicked!</p>
          <h1 className="text-3xl  py-3 lg:py-0 font-bold text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">What I love doing</h1>
          <p className="text-xl text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">I love public speaking.
Connecting with people.
Story telling.
Cracking really bad jokes.
Making awareness cool!

I often speak at corporate events, education institutions and conferences.

My content centers around awareness.

I believe that most people make choices in life because they don’t know any better.
And my ambition is to help people make those same choices completely aware of all other options.</p>
          <p className="text-xl py-3 lg:py-3 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">I would like to believe “awareness is everything.”</p>
          <div className="twowala py-3 lg:py-8 flex flex-row justify-start items-center text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">
            <div className="line bg-blue-500 h-8 w-[6px] lg:h-8 lg:w-[6px]"></div>
            <h1 className="text-xl px-2 lg:px-5">My life motto is <span className="lg:text-xl text-lg lg:px-5 font-bold" >“DO EPIC SHIT“</span>.</h1>
          </div>

          <p className="text-xl py-2 lg:py-2 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">Where DO is about action, EPIC is about a cause larger than oneself and SHIT is having fun while living life.</p>
          <p className="text-xl pb-20 lg:pb-20 text-left pl-12 lg:pl-[295px]">I live and breathe this motto by being very action oriented, picking up large difficult problems to work on and thoroughly enjoying the journey rather than aim for a goal.</p>
